Can fanciful fashion become a force for good?Since the disaster in Bangladesh in April, when the crumbling of a faulty factory killed more than 1,000 female seamstresses, fast fashion has developed a toxic reputation.
The ugly side of pretty things was epitomized by the image of a sultry Beyonce wearing an inexpensive bikini on billboards across the world.
Yet this same star was rocking it on June 1 at a concert in London as she sang a heartfelt duet of Crazy in Love with her husband, Jay-Z.
The music event was called Sound of Change Live and it was organized by the Chime for Change women's campaign and underwritten by Gucci, once known as a brand of soft shoes and hard partying but now aiming to bring attention to women's rights to education, justice and health.
I am hoping this concert has inspired people to come together to support women.
Chime is a sound of many bells vibrating, and through technology we can do it very easily, said Salma Hayek, whose husband, Franois-Henri Pinault, has made it a mission for his luxury group, formerly PPR, but now named Kering, to support best practices in his own empire  and to support Chime for Change, a women�s empowerment initiative.
The superstar list of celebrities, from Jennifer Lopez to Madonna, who chimed for education and came onstage with the Pakistani education activist Humaira Bachal and the Academy Award-winning film director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, guaranteed a large online audience, estimated at more than one billion.
The Web viewers joined the 50,000 spectators seated at the concert, in Twickenham Stadium in southwest London. The event raised more than $4 million.Prince Harry opened the event in an onscreen appearance, and with royals like Charlotte Casiraghi of Monaco and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie in the audience, the event resonated across the world, even if a Twitter feed on the concert included people asking whether Beyonce's raunchy mesh hose and barely-there costumes were symbolic of female empowerment.
For Frida Giannini, Gucci's designer, the idea, more than a year in the planning, had been to reinterpret Bob Geldof's Live Aid from the 1980s by making celebrities the halo around an urgent cause.
But the difference is that Bob Geldof didn't have partners, you couldn't follow him directly on TV, said Ms. Giannini, who had already used Gucci to focus on the female factor at a New York Unicef event in 2008.
I think it is a very personal thing, working for this cause, Ms. Giannini added, referring to the recent birth of her daughter.
Gucci is one of the biggest brands in the world, and it is a great opportunity to create a community of people through new media.
We have millions of fans on Facebook who cannot afford a Gucci bag but want to follow us.
Fund-raising is at the heart of Chime for Change, but there is something awkward about weighing a $2,000 handbag against the Afghan Institute of Learning, which offers education and health care to women and children, or a Pakistani school sponsored by Madonna.The Morning:Make sense of the day's news and ideas.
David Leonhardt and Times journalists guide you through what's happening and why it matters.
Yet the event drew Desmond Tutu's daughter Mpho to speak up for women's empowerment and say: Let us not fear that our individual acts are too small to change his-story into our story.
Those who sniff at the idea of stars turning out for a charitable event should listen to Ms. Obaid-Chinoy, who has brought the reality of life in Pakistan to the big screen.
In places like Pakistan, grass roots activists need a boost and outside support is often critical, the film director said.
Even within the country, pop icons lend their voices to educational and health projects and it does wonders.
Catching the attention of youth isn't always easy and engaging them is even more difficult.
If a celebrity is able to further a cause just by lending his or her voice to it, I'm all for it!
A similar view was expressed by Susan Ann Davis, chairwoman of Vital Voices, a Washington-based organization founded in 1997 by Hillary Rodham Clinton to focus on female empowerment, women's political participation and human rights.
It's challenging to catch the attention of media much less the public on important issues without the help of celebrities, VIPs, corporate titans and politicians, Ms. Davis said.
Their involvement is often the critical factor in breaking though the noise to draw attention and recruit supporters.
In the current music scene, women seem to have the most fire, from Ms. Lopez through Florence and The Machine to Rita Ora, who all showed up for the Gucci concert.One woman who was emphatically in favor of the event and its reverberation across the world was Maz Kessler, whose Catapult company, an online crowd-funding platform founded in 2012 with the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, allowed each member of the audience to become a donor.
Audience members who bought a ticket received a voucher that could be used on the Catapult site to select a cause and donate money to women's issues.
I am focused on fund-raising it is for us to take it from there and go deeper, Ms. Kessler said.
The activist thinks that the engagement of celebrities is part of the story and that there is a role to play for everyone.
But it is really difficult it's not just a double-edged sword it's got a lot of edges to it, she added, referring to the fact that people might now be prepared to talk publicly about domestic violence, but not yet about female genital mutilation.
Ms. Kessler thinks that the next weeks, as the audience from the concert chooses varied causes and issues through the Catapult site, will provide background information about which grass roots organizations appeal to donors.
Celebrities tend to have particular causes.
Ms. Hayek says that domestic violence issues are her focus, especially in her native country of Mexico.
I was always bothered by justice, and I had an urge to do something about it since I was little, she said.
I never experienced the subject of domestic violence, and when I started 20 years ago, nobody wanted to talk about it.
It was impossible to get support.
Now we know that not every country has a problem with hunger, but every country in the world has a problem with domestic violence.
Luxury companies have often been generous philanthropists.
The Pinault Foundation for Women�s Dignity and Rights was founded in 2009.
Now known as the Kering Corporate Foundation, it says its mission is to stop violence, improve women's lives.
According to the company, there are 44 partnerships with local and national nongovernmental organizations, and more than 80,000 women in 16 countries have benefited from Kering's support.
The Kering foundation marks Mr. Pinault's effort to build social and environmental responsibility into Gucci and the group's other brands, including Stella McCartney, known for her eco fashion.
On the philanthropic side, the executive is wedded to the cause of women.
My wife has been a determining factor in my supporting the cause of women and violence and how to fight against it, Mr. Pinault said.
The authorities don't do much about the situation, so maybe a private group can do something.
Only a few fashion companies have the global clout to assemble the kind of event that Gucci pulled off with the London concert.
Mr. Pinault stressed that this was not conceived as a marketing event and praised the real sincerity of Ms. Giannini.So after the enormous impact on Internet sites like Facebook, supposedly equal in response to a football final, what has changed since the concert's chimes have faded?
For me, the concert was an awareness tool, Ms. Obaid-Chinoy said.
People heard stories of women from as far away as Iran and Pakistan.
They saw images that shook them, voices that inspired them, they learned about today's frontline warriors around the world.
It was a message of hope and strength that encouraged those attending to give back.
